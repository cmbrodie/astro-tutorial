<MainLayout pageTitle="About Me">
  <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

  <p>
    I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page
    on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
  </p>

  <p>
    This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
    back and see how my journey is going!
  </p>
  <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My name is {identity.firstName}</li>
    <li>
      I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}
    </li>
    {
      identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
        <li>
          Two of my favorite hobbies are
          {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}
        </li>
      )
    }
  </ul>
  <p>Some of my skills are:</p>
  <ul class="flex">
    {skills.map((skill) => <li class="mx-3 my-2">{skill}</li>)}
  </ul>
  {happy && <p>Me am ver Happy!</p>}
  {finished && <p>I am Finished!</p>}
  {
    goal === 2 ? (
      <p>My goal is to finish in 2 days</p>
    ) : (
      <p>My goal is different</p>
    )
  }
</MainLayout>
